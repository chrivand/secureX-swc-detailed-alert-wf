## SecureX Stealthwatch Cloud Detailed Alert Workflow

**Prerequisites**
1. Cisco Stealthwatch Cloud (SWC) Account
2. Cisco SecureX Account
3. Cisco Webex Teams Account

**Workflow**

This workflow is very similar to the "Stealthwatch Cloud - Webex Teams Alerts" workflow. In this workflow we are creating a custom Webex Teams message for the **Inbound Port Scanner** alert, but also creating a generic alert message for all other Alert Types. The idea here is to get started with creating more detailed alerts messages for attacks that mean more to your organization, while still have the generic alerts for all others, until a customized message is needed.
